# Test Task Framework

**Test Task Framework** is a Go-based framework designed to accelerate the implementation of various programming challenges and technical test tasks.  
It provides a **well-structured, optimized, and reusable code base** so developers can focus on solving the core problem instead of boilerplate or setup.

---

## Problem

When applying for software positions, candidates often need to implement **coding challenges**:
- Algorithms or business logic
- Structured, maintainable code
- Optimized and clean implementation

These challenges consume significant personal time, especially if the candidate must repeatedly set up infrastructure or boilerplate for each new task.

---

## Solution

This framework provides **ready-to-use primitives and structures**:
- Organized, modular codebase for quick task implementation
- Automation for repetitive setup tasks
- Optimized patterns for performance and maintainability

Developers can focus on the main problem while relying on **pre-built, reusable components**.

---

## Implemented Primitives (WIP)

- TCP client-server ✅
- Kafka client-server ✅
- GRPC server (planned)
- PostgreSQL CRUD client (planned)
- REST server (planned)
- Parallel processor (planned)

> The framework is designed to be **extensible**, allowing developers to add new primitives as needed.

---

## Getting Started

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kirill-a-belov/test_task_framework.git
cd test_task_framework
```

Run primitives or add your own test tasks using the provided modules.

## Status

Open-source and research-oriented.

Useful for developer education, interview preparation, and efficient test task implementation. 

Contributions and forks are welcome.
