A framework for implementing a various test challenges

Problem: When you are in the process of finding a new position, you often faced with necessary to implement various test challenges.
The main pain point - potential employers wants from you to implement not only a logig of some challenge or algorithm, but also a clear and neat structure and code. It takes a lot of an extra time. In situation if it's not your primaraly work and you need spent your personal time for another challenge, to save it - is a valuable.

Solution: We can not predict which logic or core task an employer would want to implement from your side. But we can have a prepared, well orgonazed code base with maximal optimisation and automatisation. This case you can focused only on a main task and save much time of your life.
